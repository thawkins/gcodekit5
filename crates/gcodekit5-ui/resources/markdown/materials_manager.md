# Materials

The Materials tab manages material presets used by CAM generators and feeds/speeds calculations.

## What materials are used for
Materials are used to:
- Provide default cutting behavior (e.g. chip type, heat sensitivity)
- Seed feeds/speeds recommendations in CAM tools
- Document hazards and coolant requirements

## Left panel: browse & filter
- **Search** by name/subcategory.
- **Category** filter groups materials (woods, plastics, ferrous/non‑ferrous metals, composites, stone/ceramic).

## Right panel: material details
Typical fields include:
- **Category / subcategory**
- **Density** (used for estimates and documentation)
- **Machinability** (relative scoring used by some calculators)
- **Tensile strength / melting point** (where applicable)
- **Chip type / heat sensitivity / abrasiveness / surface finish** (CAM heuristics)
- **Dust / fume hazard** and **coolant required**
- Notes for safety, workholding, and finishing

## Best practices
- Use clear names (e.g. “Aluminum 6061‑T6”, “Baltic Birch Plywood”, “HDPE”).
- Put supplier/temper in **subcategory** when it matters.
- Add hazard notes for dusty or fume‑producing materials.
