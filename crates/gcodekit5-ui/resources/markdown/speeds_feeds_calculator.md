# Speeds & Feeds Calculator

Provides quick reference cutting parameters (RPM + feed) for common tool/material combinations.

## What it does
- Estimates spindle speed (RPM) and feed rate based on simple machining assumptions
- Highlights that results are *starting points*, not guarantees

## How to use
1. Choose a **material**.
2. Choose a **tool**.
3. Click **Calculate**.

## Interpreting results
- Use the suggested RPM as a clamp against your machine’s max spindle speed.
- Use the feed rate as a starting point, then adjust by sound/chip load.

## Notes
- The calculator is intentionally conservative.
- Always consider: rigidity, tool stick-out, coolant, workholding, and machine power.
