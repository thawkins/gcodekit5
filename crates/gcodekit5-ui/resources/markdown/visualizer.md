# Visualizer

The Visualizer previews toolpaths and (optionally) the machine work area bounds.

## Machine bounds
Enable **Show Machine Bounds** to display the device work area.

## Experimental 3D stock removal
3D stock removal visualization is only available when **Settings → Advanced → Show experimental** is enabled.
