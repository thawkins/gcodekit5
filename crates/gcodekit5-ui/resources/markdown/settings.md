## Advanced

Advanced settings provide access to experimental features that are still in development:

- **3D Stock Removal Visualization** — Enables experimental 3D stock removal visualization in the visualizer. This feature allows you to see how the tool removes material from a stock in real-time 3D rendering.

- **STL File Import** — Enables experimental STL file import with shadow projection in the designer. This allows importing 3D STL models and projecting them to 2D shapes for machining operations.
